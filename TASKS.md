TODO LIST

- Get scaffolding to work -
- Setup basic tailwindcss and shadcn or flowbite for ui -
- Setup basic routing using latest react router dom -
- Setup basic fetch hooks for api calls -
- Make api calls and fetch data
- process and display data on ui

---

Bonus pointers

- Add loading animations for api calls (should be easier after the hooks are done)
- Make webapp responsive to 3 viewports (phone, tablet and laptop screens)
- Add additional UI elements based on the data received from api (maybe ?)
